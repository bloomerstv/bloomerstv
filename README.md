## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Apollo Client
- **Blockchain & Web3**: Lens Protocol, Ethers.js, Wagmi, RainbowKit
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Streaming**: Livepeer, HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **File Storage**: IPFS (via 4everland STS Token)
- **UI/UX**: MUI (Material-UI), Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **GraphQL**: GraphQL, Apollo Client, GraphQL Code Generator

## Important Note

We intentionally maintain Zustand at version ^4.5.5 and avoid updating to ^5.0.3. This is to ensure compatibility with existing client localStorage data structures. Updating to Zustand v5 would break stored state for existing users due to internal storage format changes.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16.x or higher)
- MongoDB
- pnpm (v8.x or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
   git clone https://github.com/bloomerstv/bloomerstv.git

   cd bloomerstv
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
    pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

   In the root directory, rename `sample.env` to `.env.local`

```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STS_TOKEN_URL=""
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RAINBOW_KIT_PROJECT_ID=""
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LENS_MODE="mainnet"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_API_MODE="production"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_NODE_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

You need to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_STS_TOKEN_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAINBOW_KIT_PROJECT_ID`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_NODE_API_URL`.

- **LOCAL_NODE_API_URL**: This is the base URL for the local API server. By default, it is set to `http://localhost:8000`.
- **RAINBOW_KIT_PROJECT_ID**: To get your `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAINBOW_KIT_PROJECT_ID`, follow the instructions in [RainbowKit's migration guide](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/migration-guide#2-supply-a-walletconnect-cloud-projectid). You'll need to create a project on WalletConnect Cloud and obtain your project ID.
- **STS Token URL**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_STS_TOKEN_URL` is the 4everland STS token URL, used in [uploadToIPFS.ts](/utils/uploadToIPFS.ts) to upload files and get an IPFS hash. If you want to use a different IPFS provider, update the `uploadToIPFS` function in [uploadToIPFS.ts](/utils/uploadToIPFS.ts) to set the provider of your choice. If you want to use 4everland, create your own STS token URL using the instructions [here](https://docs.4everland.org/storage/bucket/4ever-security-token-service-api).

4. Run the development server:

   `pnpm run dev`

   The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Access Notes

Currently, our production API is CORS-protected. While it can be used on localhost, if you want to use it on your site, please open an issue and mention your domain to be whitelisted for CORS.

The GraphQL API will soon be open for all users without any restrictions; however, this is dependent on funding.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request or open an issue for any suggestions or bug reports.

## Widgets

Explore our dedicated [Widgets Repository](https://github.com/bloomerstv/widgets) for stream overlays, including features like a chat box for live chat and an alert box for notifications, such as who collected the stream post or new followers.
